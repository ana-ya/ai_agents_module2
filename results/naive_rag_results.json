However, as of December 31, 2023, and June 30, 2024, there was no commercial paper outstanding.\n   - The short-term debt also includes the current portion of certain long-term debt, although specific amounts are not provided in the context.\n\n2. **Long-Term Debt**:\n   - The total outstanding long-term debt is summarized in millions, although specific figures for total long-term debt are not provided in the context.\n   - The company issued long-term debt in August 2020, with at least one issuance amounting to $10 billion, indicating a significant long-term financial commitment.\n\nIn summary, the company has a substantial debt structure with a capability for short-term financing through commercial paper, but it currently has no outstanding commercial paper.
