      "answer": "The company's operating expenses increased, which included an increase in stock-based compensation (SBC) expense. However, the operating income also benefited from a reduction in costs due to changes in the estimated useful lives of servers and certain network equipment. This indicates that while operating expenses rose, there were mitigating factors that positively impacted operating income.",

The effectiveness of these hedging strategies can also influence financial outcomes.\n\n4. **Impact on Financial Reporting**: The company utilizes non-GAAP metrics such as constant currency revenues and percentage change in constant currency revenues to provide a clearer picture of performance, accounting for the effects of currency fluctuations. This highlights the importance of currency exchange rates in assessing financial and operational performance.\n\nOverall, the company's international operations and exposure to various currencies present both operational and financial challenges related",

      "question": "How does the company manage interest rate and credit risks?",
      "answer": "The company manages interest rate risk by investing primarily in debt securities, including those issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, as well as corporate and foreign government debt. By diversifying its investments across fixed rate and floating rate interest-earning securities, the company mitigates the impact of interest rate fluctuations. Fixed rate securities may be adversely affected by rising interest rates, while floating rate securities may yield less income if interest rates fall; thus, the company is aware of these risks and structures its portfolio accordingly.\n\nTo manage credit risk, the company limits the amount of credit exposure to any single issuer, reducing the potential impact of default by any one entity on its overall investment portfolio. This strategy helps to preserve capital and maintain liquidity while aiming for a stable return. Additionally, the company monitors unrealized gains or losses on its marketable debt securities, which are primarily influenced by interest rate changes compared to the rates at the time of purchase.",
