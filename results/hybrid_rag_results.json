      "answer": "The company's foreign currency and international risks include:\n\n1. **Fluctuations in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates**: The company is exposed to risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. Since it transacts business globally and earns revenues in multiple currencies, any fluctuations in these exchange rates can significantly impact its financial performance.\n\n2. **International Revenues**: A significant portion of the company's revenues comes from international transactions, which are denominated in various foreign currencies. This makes the company vulnerable to the volatility of currency exchange rates, affecting both revenue and expenses.\n\n3. **Costs and Expenses in Foreign Currencies**: The company's costs and expenses are also denominated in foreign currencies, which adds another layer of risk. Changes in exchange rates can lead to increased costs when converted to U.S. dollars.\n\n4. **Impact on Financial Comparisons**: The effects of currency exchange rates are crucial for understanding period-to-period financial comparisons. The company uses non-GAAP constant currency revenues to provide a clearer picture of its financial performance, excluding the effects of currency fluctuations. \n\nOverall, these risks highlight the company's exposure to international market dynamics and the importance of managing currency exchange rate movements to safeguard its financial health.",
