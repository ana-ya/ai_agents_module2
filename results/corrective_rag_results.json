However, it is noted that there was **no commercial paper outstanding** as of these dates.\n   - The short-term debt balance also includes the current portion of certain long-term debt.\n\n2. **Long-Term Debt**:\n   - The details of the long-term debt are summarized in millions, though specific figures are not provided in the context. \n   - There is an indication that in **August 2020**, Alphabet issued **$10 billion** in long-term debt.\n\nOverall, the company's outstanding debt obligations appear to be managed through a combination of commercial paper for short-term needs and longer-term debt instruments, with an emphasis on general corporate purposes. The absence of outstanding commercial paper as of the specified dates indicates a current lack of short-term borrowing under that program.",

This can lead to either gains or losses depending on the strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar.\n\n2. **Impact of U.S. Dollar Strengthening**: When the U.S. dollar strengthens, it can lead to gains from foreign currency options and forwards. However, these gains may reduce the foreign currency losses related to earnings rather than eliminate them entirely.\n\n3. **Impact of U.S. Dollar Weakening**: Conversely, when the U.S. dollar weakens, it can result in losses from foreign currency collars and forwards, which may offset any foreign currency gains related to earnings.\n\n4. **Hedging Contracts**: The company uses hedging contracts such as foreign currency options, forwards, and collars to mitigate these risks. While these hedging strategies can reduce the effects of currency fluctuations, they do not completely eliminate the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate movements.\n\n5. **International Revenue and Costs**: The company's international revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies contribute to the overall financial market risks, which include not only foreign currency exchange risks",

      "answer": "The context provided does not explicitly outline the specific strategies the company uses to manage interest rate and credit risks. However, it does indicate that the company is aware of these risks associated with their investments in fixed rate and floating rate interest-earning securities. \n\nTo manage interest rate risk, companies typically diversify their portfolio across different types of securities, which may include both fixed and floating rate instruments. They may also use financial derivatives such as interest rate swaps or options to hedge against fluctuations in interest rates.\n\nFor credit risk management, companies often limit exposure to any single issuer to reduce the potential impact of a default. They might also conduct thorough credit analyses and continuously monitor the credit ratings of their investments.\n\nTo summarize, while the specific management strategies are not detailed in the context, commonly employed practices include diversification, the use of hedging instruments, and monitoring issuer creditworthiness.",

      "answer": "The company's approach to risk management and internal controls is guided by the criteria established in the Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). This framework emphasizes the importance of effective internal controls over financial reporting, which the company regularly evaluates. The management is responsible for the financial statements and internal controls, and independent auditors express their opinions on these controls, as evidenced by the unqualified opinions issued for the years ending December 31, 2020, 2023, and the anticipated opinion for December 31, 2024. This indicates a commitment to maintaining robust internal controls and ensuring accountability in financial reporting.",
